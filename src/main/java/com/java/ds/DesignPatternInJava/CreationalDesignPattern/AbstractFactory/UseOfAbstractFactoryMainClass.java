/*
 * Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating
 * families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.
 * That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes. 
 * So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
 * An Abstract Factory Pattern is also known as Kit.
 * When you want to provide a library of objects that does not show implementations and 
 * only reveals interfaces.
 * When the system needs to be configured with one of a multiple family of objects.
